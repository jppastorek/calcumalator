# calcumalator
This is a project to create a calculator, basically to brush up on my skills in Python. I took the course on Codecademy a couple years ago, and now I am trying to get some projects in motion to build a portfolio. I hope to improve my skills through this project, not necessarily reinvent the calculator.

I still have a ways to go regarding style and function...as you can see.

As of now, there is a funny little problem. When you input your first equation and then press the equals sign, it always does an addition problem.
For example, if I input 5 * 5 and then press =, the entry would display 10 even though the answer should be 25. Once you do that first problem, all the others work just fine.
